    "How to maintain software modules in the HPC cluster\n",
    "\n",
    "In the HPC cluster, commonly used software that is not part of the standard Linux system is installed in a centrally managed software repository. The repository is mounted on the access (mentat001 ~ mentat005) and compute nodes under the /opt directory. The user enables a specific software package using the module command, e.g., with module add R/3.4.0.\n",
    "Installing software and organizing versions\n",
    "\n",
    "Within /opt, each software package is organized in a separate sub-directory. The maintainer of a specific software package has the owner permission of that sub-directory. Thus, before you can install software under the /opt directory, you need to be the maintainer of the software and take the :ref:`software-maintainer` responsibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "The maintainer installs software and organizes versions. An example file system tree structure below shows how different versions of the software R is organized.\n"
